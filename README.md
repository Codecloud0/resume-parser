In this "Resume Parser" project, you can trim out and get a separated view of phone number and email of an resume pdf. 

-> To run this code, you need to install some dependencies and maybe a newer version of python.
-> To do this, open command prompt and run this -
1. python -m pip install --upgrade pip
2. pip install pdfplumber
                          Also check the Python version from this code
   python --version

Any others issue shouldn't be facing after this.

Thank you for reading this :)
Happy coding!
